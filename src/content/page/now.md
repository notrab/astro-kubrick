Over the last few years I've been working closely with a lot of companies embracing headless content, GraphQL, databases, headless commerce, headless APIs, and before that, Ruby on Rails.

I'm currently working at [Turso](https://turso.tech), on all things developer experience. I spend most of my days writing documentation, working as a marketing engineer, speaking with users, maintaining example apps, and working with the community.

## Things I'm working on

- [My YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@notrab) &mdash; occasional video tutorials.
- [SWAG Boilerplate](https://swagboilerplate.com) &mdash; Launch your own dropshipping store.
- [GraphQL.wtf](https://graphql.wtf) &mdash; GraphQL tutorials and resources.
- [CartQL](https://cartql.com) &mdash; A GraphQL Shopping Cart API that works with your existing product inventory.
- [awesome-headless-commerce](https://github.com/notrab/awesome-headless-commerce) &mdash; Awesome resources for headless commerce.
- [NameGuard](https://nameguard.io) &mdash; Protect your community
  with NameGuard for ENS.

Want to collaborate on something? I'm always looking to learn, teach, and build.
